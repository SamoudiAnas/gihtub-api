# Github API project

This project was created with React.js



## Libraries used

In this project, if have used the following libraries:*

  - Axios (to get auto easily instead of using the fetch method)
  - Moment (to get the time interval from the date of the creation of the github repository)
  - Styled Components (this one isn't necessary. It is just my preference it keeps my code clean and organised)

### How to run the code
 
 1- Download the repository files in zip format and then extract them
 2- Open Command prompt (or terminal if you are on Linux)
 3- Go the repository where you extracted the code files with this command : 
 
 ```sh
cd ${CODE_FILES_DIRECTORY}
```
  4- Finally run :
  
 ```sh
npm install && npm start
```

This will download the necessary packages to run to app and then it will prompt on window on your default bowser.
